## Original problem

3/31/2024

I'm at my friend's and he's made a chili with 11 different beans; each ladle has 140 beans; what is the odds of a ladle not containing at least one of all 11 beans?

I suggested calculating the odds of not getting bean A, and then add that probability 10 more times... But my friend says that can't work

So do you mean supposing bean A is the forbidden bean, then you have to pick 140 non-A beans in a row, with probability (10/11)^140 = 1.6e-6. But then that's favoring a particular bean A, so the probability is about 11 times higher?
